                   Logging code Cleanup plugin for Eclipse

This is an extension of the Eclipse Clean Ups which detects invocations of the
logging methods with compound arguments (i.e. arguments that require computation
before the method call) and prefixes them with corresponding if statements.

For example, the code:
    log.debug("Me: " + this) 

is replaced with:
    if (log.isDebugEnabled()) log.debug("Me: " + this)


The following logging frameworks are supported:

Java Util Logging
Log4j
SLF4J

The plugin provides an extension point which allows to add support 
for other frameworks.
